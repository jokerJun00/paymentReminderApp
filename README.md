# payment_reminder_app

This is my FYP project. An Android Flutter app that helps users to record and remind users to pay their expenses on time. It uses the Flutter framework as the main programming language and integrates with Firebase as the Cloud database. It follows the **Clean architecture** and **Bloc architecture** to develop the application. It also runs unit test, integration test, and Bloc test to test the application functionality.

1. *Upcoming payment list* to show users their upcoming payments in the coming week to let them plan their finances.
2. *Monthly expenses summary dashboard* to tell users their monthly spending.

4. View user's *payments history* for them to track back their payment records.
5. *Push notification* to remind users of their upcoming payment (weekly, monthly, yearly).
