# payment_reminder_app

This is my FYP project. A Flutter app that help users to records and remind to pay their expenses on time.

## Project Structure
This Flutter app uses Flutter Dart as the main programming language to create a cross-platform mobile app. It follows the BloC clean architecture for state management and Firestore as the database storage.
